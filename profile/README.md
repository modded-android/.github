<h2 align="center"> Whtat is Modded Android? </h2>



<h2 align="center"> Why Now? </h2>



<h2 align="center"> Money? </h2>



<h2 align="center"> Goals? </h2>

yes, we have a series of goals

we want to target a single platform for MA, at least in the beginning. this will allow us to create optimizations that we otherwise would be unable to work on.

we also plan on migrating all legacy code (java/kotlin/c/cpp) to modern equivilents like rust/zig/nim/v, with things like go/carbon used where needed.
