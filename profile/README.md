# Modded Android

### README is a WIP

## The Problem

to put it simply the problem is Google. to be more refined about it, Google has converted the AOSP project from an open and fun project into their latest way to lock you in their ecosystem, harvest your data, and sell your security to the highest bidder. This needs to change.

## The Solution

a community driven fork of the AOSProject. Desined to return control to the community and the consumers. Not security focused, removing the proprietary blobs will help with that, a fork that is focused on easy of use, privacy, and peace of mind.

## Overview
Modded Android is a full fork of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), built from the ground up to return to the core principles of AOSP: openness, flexibility, and user control. Our mission is to provide a clean, customizable, and community-driven Android experience, free from bloatware and proprietary constraints, while staying true to the spirit of open-source development.

## Current Goals

we are currently replacing a number of applications and configurations. namely in the system partition. Things like Gmail, messages, the keyboard and the DNS configuration are being replaced by open and transparent alternatives. These include but are not limited too Proton applications, the FUTO Keyboard and NextDNS. 

## Philosophy
Modded Android aims to:
- **Restore AOSP's Roots**: Focus on a lightweight, transparent, and customizable operating system, prioritizing user freedom.
- **Empower Users and Developers**: Offer extensive customization options and a modular framework for developers to build upon.
- **Maintain Openness**: Ensure all* code is open-source, community-driven, and free from unnecessary vendor integrations.

## Features
- **Pure AOSP Base**: Built directly from AOSP, stripped of proprietary apps and services.
- **Enhanced Customization**: Advanced theming, granular privacy controls, and flexible system tweaks.
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight design for faster performance and better battery efficiency.
- **Community-Driven**: Regular updates driven by community feedback and contributions.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive documentation and tools for building custom ROMs and apps.
- **Custom Hardware**: a goal of creating an open hardware for Modded Android to run on, more information is availible upon request in the [Discord](https://inv.wtf/deadinside)
