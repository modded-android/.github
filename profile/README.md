<h2 align="center"> What is Modded Android? </h2>

> [!NOTE]
> Modded Android is not like [Librephone]. They are generally targetting the ecosystem of platforms that Android serves, we are being extremely surgical about what we are building

<h2 align="center"> Why Now? </h2>

[Google] is no longer dealing with Android in good faith in my opinion, and in order to fight back we forked the 14th generation of android to create Modded Android. It is a thing we have wanted to do for a while, and we have seen a lot of Android based operating systems out there like [Lineage] and [Graphene]. Modded Android is different then them as it is a full fork with full intentions to fully rewrite it, and create it's own competing ecosystem.

<h2 align="center"> Money? </h2>

hi, im austin - the founder/creator/dev/filltheblank for Modded Android at the time of writing. If you wanna gimme money, i am not going to stop you, this project will get expensive fast. you can visit my [guns] biolink and use one of the links there, cashapp/kofi/patreon, even cryptocurrency if that is your jam

<h2 align="center"> Goals? </h2>

yes, we have a series of goals

we want to target a single platform for MA, at least in the beginning. this will allow us to create optimizations that we otherwise would be unable to work on.

we also plan on migrating all legacy code ([Java]/[kotlin]/c/cpp) to modern equivilents like [rust]/[zig]/[nim]/v, with things like go/carbon used where needed.
